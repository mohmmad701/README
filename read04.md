![this figure about the sycle of html css and javascrirpt ](https://image.shutterstock.com/shutterstock/photos/1188713476/display_1500/stock-vector-vector-collection-of-web-development-shield-signs-html-css-and-javascript-1188713476.jpg)
#  how i can fix the language and use them from the same project 
* i need to know the html have  syntax like *<htm>*
the css have a deferant syntax *{css}* and the java script have a syntax like  *javascrirpt()*

## the file using html have a  name of file.html 
## the   file using css have a  name of file.css
 file using html have a  name of  name of file.js
 
 # the javascrirpt is a programming language to make a website interactive and  adding functionality and olse you can easy to use easy to view and the javascrirpt have a logic but the html its a huuper marker languge 
  

 
  ##  i can write  acode using javascrirpt like:
 ** <script> and write somthing here </script>**
 ##  when we need to upload the linke of extearnal javascrirpt we need to write this cod inside body like 

 <script src ="the link.js"></script>

 # the more important about javascrirpt:
 1 **i can write a commit using //write somthing i use it to description about any this in the code**
 2 **i have a datatype using javascrirpt** 
  
 #  numaricdatatype:
1. string 
2. integer
3. double and float

# Asignmet Operator:
- =
- +=
- -=
##for example:


=	x = y	x = y
+=	x += y	x = x + y
-=	x -= y	x = x - y
*=	x *= y	x = x * y

how i can see the output using this code:
var x=5;
console.log(x); **//x is a variable and the output is 5**
