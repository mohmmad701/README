HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.

With HTML you can create your own Website.
 # HTML & CSS: Designing and Building Web Sites teaches readers the basics of HTML and CSS. This book is unique because it throws away dull templates and presents the information in full color, with the use of helpful info-graphics. It starts by introducing structure and hierarchy rather than jumping with the first elements or how websites work. Since a picture can often tell a thousand words, the book introduces each new element in a visual way, relying on images and diagrams rather than pages of text. It then goes on to discuss CSS, and teaches the reader how to control how their pages will look / appear. As a value-add, the book is accompanied by a website that the user can download to their computer with lots of examples and exercises to try for themselves. The book covers: structure, text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, useful options, adding style w/CSS, controlling fonts, colors, thinking in boxes, styling lists, styling tables, layouts, using grids, and offers practical advice about SEO, Google analytics, ftp, and HTML5 all in beautifully rendered 4-color ease of reading. The reader will learn:

Adding images to a page

he <table> tag defines an HTML table.

Each table row is defined with a <tr> tag. Each table header is defined with a <th> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <td> tag.

By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered.
