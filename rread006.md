## What Is A JavaScript:
* JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

### JavaScript includes following categories of operators.

1-Arithmetic Operators like: **+,-,*,/,%,++,--**//return number
2-Comparison Operators like:** !=,==,===,<=,>=,<,>**return true or false 
3-Logical Operators like:|| ,&&,!
4-Assignment Operators like:=,+=,-=,*=,%=,/=

5-Conditional Operators

### What is the function in JavaScript:
* JavaScript provides functions similar to most of the scripting and programming languages.

 * In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want.

* A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword.
