# introdution about markdown 

markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
whenwe write something like bolding we need to write the syntax like :
my name : mohammad  using bolding  **my name : mohammad**
when i need to write italic i need * my name :mohammad*
