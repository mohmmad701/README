  ##  i can write  acode using javascrirpt like:
 ** <script> and write somthing here </script>**
 ##  when we need to upload the linke of extearnal javascrirpt we need to write this cod inside body like 

 <script src ="the link.js"></script>

 # the more important about javascrirpt:
 1 **i can write a commit using //write somthing i use it to description about any this in the code**
 2 **i have a datatype using javascrirpt** 
  
 #  numaricdatatype:
1. string 
2. integer
3. double and float

# Asignmet Operator:
- =
- +=
- -=
##for example:


=	x = y	x = y
+=	x += y	x = x + y
-=	x -= y	x = x - y
*=	x *= y	x = x * y

how i can see the output using this code:
var x=5;
console.log(x); **//x is a variable and the output is 5**
